# Arithmetic Operators( Works for all single value datatypes or Numbers)
'''
Python Arithmetic Operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
'''
#1.Addition operator(+) = It is used to add two or more operands
#Example
number = 10
Number = 10.0
sum = number + Number
print(sum)

#2.Subtraction operator(-) = It is used to subract two or more operands
#Example
number = 10
Number = 11
sub = number - Number
print(sub)

#3.Multiplication operator(*) = It is used to two or more operands
#Example
number = 10
Number = 11
mul = number * Number
print(mul)

#3.Divison operator(/) = It is used to divide the first operand by the second
#Example
number = 10
Number = 3
div = number/Number
print(div) # Output will be 3.3333333333333335 the output will be float

#4.Floor Divison(//) = It is used to divide the first operand by the second
#Example
number = 10
Number = 3
div = number//Number
print(div) # Output will be 3 as floor divison will give output as int

#5.Modulus Operator(%) = It returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second
#Example
number = 129
Number = 10
rem = number % Number
print(rem) # Output will be 9

#6.Exponential operator(**) = In Python, ** is the exponentiation operator. It is used to raise the first operand to the power of the second.
Number = 10
pow = Number ** 2
print(pow)
